"""Ringr Lambda Function â€“ Manage Endpoints

AWS Lambda function for managing endpoints based on events in the Ringr
DynamoDB table. Depending on the action recorded in the DynamoDB
database stream, this function will do one of several things:

- INSERT: If an endpoint has been added to the DynamoDB database, no
    action is taken.

- MODIFIY: If an endpoint has been modified in the DynamoDB database
    (and it's ARN has changed) the old endpoint ARN will be removed from
    the SNS topic.

- REMOVE: If an endpoint has been removed from the DynamoDB database, it
    is removed from the SNS topic.
